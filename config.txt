n=1
[the number of bits of each integer that will be used for its hash code]

showInitialRelations=yes
[choose "yes" to see the contents of the initial relations before and
after the reordering or choose "no" so these details are not printed]

showAuxiliaryArrays=yes
[choose "yes" to see the contents of the histograms and the prefix sums
of both relations (and subrelations) or choose "no" to not display them]

showSubrelations=yes
[choose "yes" to see the contents concerning the subrelations (initial
contents, contents after reordering, histograms, prefix sums) or choose
"no" to not display any information about the subrelations. In case the
chosen value for this option is "yes", the initial contents as well as
the contents after the reordering will be printed only if the value of
the flag 'showInitialRelations' is "yes". The contents of the auxiliary
arrays will be printed if the value of 'showAuxiliaryArrays' is "yes"]
